# Jira Account Creation

## Summary
This feature helps projects create Jira accounts for users wishing to interact with projects using the 
Jira issue tracker for development purposes. As public signup for Jira accounts has been disabled 
(as per [this thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/jx9d7sp690ro660pjpttwtg209w3m39w)), projects 
now need to use this tool to set up accounts for new users.

## Canonical URL
https://selfserve.apache.org/jira-acct.html

## Serviced managed by this feature
- Jira issue tracking platform, https://issues.apache.org/jira/

## Intended audience
This feature is intended for both top-level projects and podlings.

## Access level(s) required
Full access to this feature is granted to anyone on a PMC or PPMC.

## Notification scheme
New account creations will notify [notifications@infra.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?notifications@infra.apache.org) for provenance and audit reasons.
The original account requestor will also be notified via email with a detailed description of how to proceed with the new account.
