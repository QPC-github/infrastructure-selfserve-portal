<h1>Create a git repository</h1>

Git repositories can be managed via the Boxer platform at: <a href="https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/">https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/</a>.<br/>
The Boxer platform allows you to see which git repositories you have read/write access to, as well as create new repositories.
